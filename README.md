# Heart-disease-prediction-by-Machine-Learning
<br>
Analyzed the data of 303 patients & predicted their heart disease by using Logistic Regression.
<br>
<br>
Work flow of the project will be as follows-

Libraries we used for the Processing the data-
<br>
<br>
1-Numpy
<br>
2-Pandas
<br>
3-Sikit learn
<br>
<br>
Categorized the data into 2 sectors like 'x' for the patient's entire health factors & 'y' for 'target' that is as the label.
<br>
<br>
Splitting data into train & test.
<br>
<br>
Trained model with the LogisticRegression function.
<br>
<br>
Logistic Regression-
<br>
<br>
It’s a popular classification algorithm used in ML. It's part of  the Sikit learn library  in Python. Regression is suitable for binary classification problems where the target variable has 2 classes. Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.
<br>
<br>
After checking the accuracy of both the training & test we checked the implementation of the model with new data.
<br>
Accuracy Score-
<br>
To check the accuracy of the model we used the 'accuracy score' function.
<br>
It’s a function that is a performance metric provided by sikit learn library  in Python. It is commonly used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by measuring the accuracy of its prediction.
<br>
<br>
Reshape new data-
<br>
While building the predictive system for new data we need to reshape the data that is we need to inform numpy array that we are going to predict the result for only one line of data.
